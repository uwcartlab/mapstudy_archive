# Mapstudy Archive
This Github page serves as the official archive of research projects completed using the [Mapstudy](https://github.com/uwcartlab/mapstudy) tool. Mapstudy is used to test cartographic and interaction research hypotheses on the web. Some of the studies have associated publications available on the [UW Cart Lab](https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/research/index.html) website, while others are still in progress.
