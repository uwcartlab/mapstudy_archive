							"ask": "<strong>Thank you for agreeing to participate!</strong></br></br>Digital interactive maps are now a part of our everyday lives. This research investigates how such interactive maps can or cannot help us make choices about the management and regulation of commodities in the landscape.</br></br> Specifically, the following survey uses the North American regulation and trade of hazardous waste as a case study. Tons of hazardous waste are traded among Canada, Mexico, and the United States daily, creating many management decisions that ensure safe disposal. Such choices about how to regulate hazardous waste are complex, requiring consideration of a number of potential solutions. In this study, you will be asked to make two different decisions about the hazardous waste trade using information provided in an interactive map.</br></br><strong><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></strong></br></br>The survey proceeds in four sections: <ol><li>First, you will be given an example map to familiarize yourself with the map symbols and map controls used in the study. You also will be given an example task to get a feel for the kinds of decisions you will need to make with the interactive maps. Use as much time as you wish to study the example map and learn how to use its controls, as these responses are not recorded.</li><li>You then will be presented with two different scenarios related to the regulation and trade of hazardous waste. Each scenario focuses on a different region in the United States and includes a different interactive map to support your decision. For each scenario, make use of the interactive map to arrive at a decision you feel is <strong>optimal</strong>. After each decision, you will be asked to assess your <strong>confidence</strong> in the decision solution and to rate your <strong>difficulty</strong> in making this choice. Please complete these questions using your <strong>complete focus</strong> (do not view other websites, split your attention, etc.).</li><li>Between the two scenarios, you will complete a set of map reading tasks with a static map showing the distribution of hazardous waste imports in the United States. Please complete these questions using your <strong>complete focus</strong>, as they are meant to refresh your train of thought from the prior decision.</li><li>After completing all map tasks, you will respond to a series of background questions about your interests and experiences. You will be compensated after you submit the background survey.</li></ol>Throughout the survey, <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the web browser “Back” or “Forward” buttons or close your browser, as this will require you to restart the survey. Only use the “Next” buttons found at the bottom of the pages to advance the survey.</br></br><strong><u>ELIGIBILITY:</u></strong></br></br>Before beginning, please once again review your eligibility for participating in the study. These restrictions greatly impact your responses:</br><ul><li>You must be 18 years of age or older.</li><li>English must be your first language.</li><li>You must currently be living in the United States, but not in the states of Ohio or Texas, the location of the pair of scenarios. </li><li>You must complete the survey on a laptop or desktop computer (i.e., <strong>NOT</strong> a mobile device such as a phone or tablet). </li></ul></br></br><strong>Select 'Next' to confirm that you have read the instructions and confirm that you are eligible and ready to view the example map.</strong>"
